# Android-Interview-Questions-Answer 

I have try to make collection of interview questions-answer related to Android with java and kotlin.

## **Kotlin** :-

1. Why should we use Kotlin (benefits over java	)?
	
	-> 1. Shorter program for the same task - It's (way) More Concise Than Java    
	-> 2. Easy Code    
	-> 3. Java Compatibility - It's Completely Interoperable With Java    
	-> 4. Eliminating Null References: - Safer Code    
	-> 5. Solution To Some Of Javaâ€™s Flaws   
	
2. How to declare a variable in Kotlin?

	To declare a variable in Kotlin, either var or val keyword is used. Here is an example:    

	var language = "Hindi"    
	val score = 95    
	
	However, you can explicitly specify the type if you want to:    

	var language: String = "English"    
	val score: Int = 95    
	
4. Difference Between var and val    

	val (Immutable reference) - The variable declared using val keyword cannot be changed once the value is assigned. It is similar to final variable in Java.    
	
	var (Mutable reference) - The variable declared using var keyword can be changed later in the program. It corresponds to regular Java variable.    
	
	Here are few examples:    

	var language = "Hindi"    
	language = "English"         
	Here, language variable is reassigned to German. Since, the variable is declared using var, this code work perfectly.    

	val language = "Hindi"    
	language = "English"      // Error 
	
5. Kotlin Basic Data Types

	Kotlin is a statically typed language like Java. That is, the type of a variable is known during the compile time. For example,    

	val language: Int    
	val marks = 12.3    
	Here, the compiler knows that language is of type Int, and marks is of type Double before the compile time.    

	The built-in types in Kotlin can be categorized as:    

	*Numbers    
	*Characters    
	*Booleans    
	*Arrays    
	
6. what is varang keyword in kotlin    

	Sometimes we need a function where we can pass n number of parameters, and the value of n can be decided at runtime. Kotlin provides us to achieve the same by 		defining a parameter of a function as vararg. We can pass n number of parameters to a vararg variable of the defined datatype or even of a generic type. 	
	Example :    
	
	fun getAverage(vararg input: Int): Float {    
   		var sum = 0.0f    
    		for (item in input) {    
        		sum += item    
    		}
    		return (sum / input.size)    
	}    
	val result1 = getAverage(1, 2, 3)    
	val result2 = getAverage(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)    
	
7. what is JvmStatic Annotation in Kotlin

	JvmStatic Annotation is used to call kotlin method from java in kotlin style
	Ex :- object AppUtils {
		 @JvmStatic
    		fun install() {
    	}
	Now, we can call install() method from Java as below:
	AppUtils.install();
}

8. what is JvmOverloads Annotation in Kotlin

	Kotlin support default parameters and Java support method overloading.
	
	Assume that we have a data class Session in Kotlin as below:
	-data class Session(val name: String, val date: Date = Date())
	-We can create the objects in Kotlin as below:
	
	val sessionOne = Session("Session One", Date())
	val sessionTwo = Session("Session Two")
	
	Both the lines of the code will compile as expected as for the 2nd object, it -will take the default value of the Date.
	
	-But, when we create the objects from Java as below:

	-Session sessionOne = new Session("Session One", new Date());
	-Session sessionTwo = new Session("Session Two"); // compilation error
	-The first line will compile, but the second line will not as we have not passed Data as a parameter. It will give us the error:
	
	As we know that Java does not support default parameters. It supports overloading.
	So, we will have to use @JvmOverloads. It instructs the Kotlin compiler to generate overloads for the function that substitute default parameter values
	
	-Let's update our data class Session as below:

	-data class Session @JvmOverloads constructor(val name: String, val date: Date = Date())
	-Notice that we have used @JvmOverloads to instruct the Kotlin compiler to generate overloads for the function.

	-Now, if we create the objects from Java as below:

	-Session sessionOne = new Session("Session One", new Date());
	-Session sessionTwo = new Session("Session Two");
	
	-And, it works perfectly. Both the lines of the code will compile as expected as the Kotlin compiler has generated the overloads for the function.

	-This is how we can use the JvmOverloads annotation in Kotlin.
