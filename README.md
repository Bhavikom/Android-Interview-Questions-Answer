# Android-Interview-Questions-Answer 

I have try to make collection of interview questions-answer related to Android with java and kotlin.

## **Kotlin** :-

1. Why should we use Kotlin (benefits over java	)?
	
	-> 1. Shorter program for the same task - It's (way) More Concise Than Java    
	-> 2. Easy Code    
	-> 3. Java Compatibility - It's Completely Interoperable With Java    
	-> 4. Eliminating Null References: - Safer Code    
	-> 5. Solution To Some Of Javaâ€™s Flaws
